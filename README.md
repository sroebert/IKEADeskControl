# IKEADeskControl

## Setup

- First pair to the desk using a bluetooth utility app like LightBlue.
- Close the pairing app to avoid the desk being connected.
- Run IKEADeskControl and long press the desk pairing button until the light blinks blue.
- The IKEADeskControl app should connect now and display the UUID of the desk.
- From now on, run the IKEADeskControl app with `--uuid UUID`, using the UUID of the desk, to allow it to directly connect.
